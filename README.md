# ASW-Aquarius-OBC
ASW &amp; Aquarius Project: OBC w/ water sampling device sensors and Bar 30 

FINAL ELECTRONICS 
My partner and I made electronic housing in conjunction with two other Aquarius teams to obtain data about Lake Michigan's conditions

My team's electronics: DS18B20 temperature sensor (external, sticks out of housing), DHT 11 humidity sensor (internal, detects leaks)

Second team's electronics: SparkFun TSL2561 LUX (luminosity) sensor

Aquarius OBC electronics: Blue Robotics Bar 30 (external, measures temperature, pressure, altitude, and depth)

Shared electronics: Teensy 3.5 and its built-in micro SD adapter, micro SD card


PAST VERSIONS
My team began wiring and coding our electronics independently at first and used an external SD card and an Arduino Uno (versions 1-3)


Code + sensor versions:
1) DS18B20
2) DS18B20 + external SD card
3) DS18B20 + external SD card + DHT
4) FINAL: DS18B20 + external SD card + DHT + LUX + Bar 30 ( last two devices were added at same time)
